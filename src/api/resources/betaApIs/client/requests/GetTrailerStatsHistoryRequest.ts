     * The stat types you want this endpoint to return information on.
     *
     * You may list **up to 3** types using comma-separated format. For example: `types=gps,reeferAmbientAirTemperatureMilliC,gpsOdometerMeters`.
     *
     * * `gps`: GPS data including lat/long, heading, speed, and a reverse geocode address.
     * * `gpsOdometerMeters`: Odometer reading provided by GPS calculations. You must provide a manual odometer reading before this value is updated. Manual odometer readings can be provided via the PATCH /fleet/trailers/{id} endpoint or through the [cloud dashboard](https://kb.samsara.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005273667-Editing-Odometer-Reading). Odometer readings wthat are manually set will update as GPS trip data is gathered.
     * * `reeferAmbientAirTemperatureMilliC`: The ambient air temperature reading of the reefer in millidegree Celsius.
     * * `reeferObdEngineSeconds`: The cumulative number of seconds the reefer has run according to onboard diagnostics. Only supported on reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferSupplyAirTemperatureMilliCZone1`: The supply or discharge air temperature zone 1 in millidegrees Celsius. For single zone reefers, this applies to the single zone. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferSupplyAirTemperatureMilliCZone2`: The supply or discharge air temperature zone 2 in millidegrees Celsius. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferSupplyAirTemperatureMilliCZone3`: The supply or discharge air temperature zone 3 in millidegrees Celsius. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferFuelPercent`: The fuel level of the reefer unit in percentage points (e.g. `99`, `50`, etc). Only supported on reefer solutions.
     * * `carrierReeferState`: The overall state of the reefer (`Off`, `On`). Only supported on multizone Carrier reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferStateZone1`: The state of the reefer in zone 1. For single zone reefers, this applies tot he single zone. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferStateZone2`: The state of the reefer in zone 2. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferStateZone3`: The state of the reefer in zone 3. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferRunMode`: The operational mode of the reefer (`Start/Stop`, `Continuous`)
     * * `reeferAlarms`: Any alarms that are present on the reefer. Only supported on reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferReturnAirTemperatureMilliCZone1`: The return air temperature in zone 1 of the reefer in millidegrees Celsius. For single zone reefers, this applies to the single zone. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
     * * `reeferReturnAirTemperatureMilliCZone2`: The return air temperature in zone 2 of the reefer in millidegrees Celsius. Only supported on multizone reefer solutions.
