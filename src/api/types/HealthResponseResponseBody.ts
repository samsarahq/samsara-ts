     *
     * * `recommendedActionAgHealthy`: Gateway is healthy. No action required.
     * * `recommendedActionAgLowDeviceBatteryAG45`: The gateway battery is low. Please contact support
     * * `recommendedActionAgLowDeviceBatteryAG46`: The gateway battery is low. Gateway batteries require replacement.
     * * `recommendedActionAgLowDeviceBatteryAG51`: Gateway batteries require replacement.
     * * `recommendedActionAgLowDeviceBatteryPoweredAG`: The gateway battery is low. Power on the asset to charge the gateway.
     * * `recommendedActionAgNoGpsSignal`: Gateway has no GPS signal. Verify that the gateway is securely attached to the exterior of the asset. Ensure that the device is outside and avoid obstructions such as underground structures, heavily insulated buildings, bridges, and trees.
     * * `recommendedActionAgNotDetected`: The gateway has not been detected for at least 24 hours. See troubleshooting steps to reboot the gateway.
     * * `recommendedActionAgUnplugged`: The asset gateway is unplugged or cut. Check the gateway connection to ensure it is plugged in and has been installed correctly
     * * `recommendedActionCmCameraMisaligned`: The position of the road-facing dash cam is not aligned with the horizon. Video quality and AI detection may be impacted. Reposition dash cam and Test Dash Cam Positioning.
     * * `recommendedActionCmHealthy`: Dash cam recording is healthy. No action required.
