     * The stat types you want this endpoint to return information on. See also the <a href="/docs/telematics#query-parameters" target="_blank">Telematics</a> guide for more details.
     *
     * You may list ***up to 4*** types using comma-separated format. For example: `types=gps,engineStates,obdOdometerMeters`.
     *
     * *Note:* `auxInput3`-`auxInput10` count as a single type against the limit of 3. For example, you could list `types=engineStates,obdOdometerMeters,auxInput3,auxInput4` because `auxInput3` and `auxInput4` count as a single stat type. `auxInput1` and `auxInput2` still count as their own individual types.
     *
     * - `ambientAirTemperatureMilliC`: The ambient air temperature reading in millidegree Celsius.
     * - `auxInput1`-`auxInput13`: Stat events from the <a href="https://kb.samsara.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043040512-Auxiliary-Inputs" target="_blank">auxiliary inputs</a> for the vehicle.
     * - `barometricPressurePa`: The barometric pressure reading in pascals.
     * - `batteryMilliVolts`: The vehicle battery voltage reading.
     * - `defLevelMilliPercent`: The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) level in milli percentage points (e.g. `99001`, `49999`, etc).
     * - `ecuSpeedMph`: The speed of the engine in miles per hour according to the ECU.
     * - `engineCoolantTemperatureMilliC`: The engine coolant temperature reading in millidegree Celsius.
     * - `engineImmobilizer`: The state of the engine immobilizer - Valid values: `ignition_disabled`, `ignition_enabled`. This stat type will only return states of our first Engine Immobilizer Hardware (ACC-EI). Please use <a href="https://developers.samsara.com/reference/getengineimmobilizerstates" target="_blank">Get engine immobilizer states</a> to get states for both Engine Immobilizer Hardware versions (incl. HW-EI21).
     * - `engineLoadPercent`: The engine load in percentage points (e.g. `99`, `50`, etc).
     * - `engineOilPressureKPa`: The engine oil pressure reading in kilopascals.
     * - `engineRpm`: The revolutions per minute of the engine.
     * - `engineStates`: The state of the engine (`Off`, `On`, `Idle`).
     * - `faultCodes`: The diagnostic fault codes for the vehicle.
     * - `fuelPercents`: The engine fuel level in percentage points (e.g. `99`, `50`, etc).
     * - `gps`: GPS data including lat/long, heading, speed, address book entry (if exists), and a reverse geocoded address.
     * - `gpsDistanceMeters`: The distance the vehicle has traveled since the gateway was installed based on GPS calculations.
     * - `gpsOdometerMeters`: Odometer reading provided by GPS calculations when OBD odometer cannot be pulled automatically. You must provide a manual odometer reading before this value is updated. Manual odometer readings can be provided via the [PATCH /fleet/vehicles/{id}](ref:updatevehicle) endpoint or through the <a href="https://kb.samsara.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005273667-Editing-Odometer-Reading" target="_blank">cloud dasbhoard</a>. Odometer readings that are manually set will update as GPS trip data is gathered. Try combining with `obdOdometerMeters`.
     * - `intakeManifoldTemperatureMilliC`: The intake manifold temperature reading in millidegree Celsius.
     * - `nfcCardScans`: ID card scans.
     * - `obdEngineSeconds`: The cumulative number of seconds the engine has run according to onboard diagnostics.
     * - `obdOdometerMeters`: The odometer reading according to onboard diagnostics. If Samsara does not have diagnostic coverage for a particular vehicle, the value for this stat type will be omitted. Try combining with `gpsOdometerMeters`.
     * - `syntheticEngineSeconds`: Data for the synthetic engine seconds for the vehicle.
     * - `evStateOfChargeMilliPercent`: Milli percent State of Charge for electric and hybrid vehicles. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evChargingStatus`: Charging status for electric and hybrid vehicles. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field. Statuses:  unknown - 0, not charging - 1, charging - 2.
     * - `evChargingEnergyMicroWh`: Charging energy for electric and hybrid vehicles in microwatt hours. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evChargingVoltageMilliVolt`: Charging voltage for electric and hybrid vehicles in milli volts. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.

     * - `evConsumedEnergyMicroWh`: Consumed energy (including regenerated) for electric and hybrid vehicles in microwatt hours. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evRegeneratedEnergyMicroWh`: Regenerated energy for electric and hybrid vehicles in microwatt hours. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evBatteryVoltageMilliVolt`: Battery voltage for electric and hybrid vehicles in milli volts. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evBatteryCurrentMilliAmp`: Battery current for electric and hybrid vehicles in milli amps. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evBatteryStateOfHealthMilliPercent`: Milli percent battery state of health for electric and hybrid vehicles. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evAverageBatteryTemperatureMilliCelsius`: Battery temperature for electric and hybrid vehicles in milli celsius. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `evDistanceDrivenMeters`: Electric distance driven for electric and hybrid vehicles in meters. Not all EV and HEVs may report this field.
     * - `spreaderLiquidRate`: Liquid spread rate reading in milliliters per meter, read from the material spreader. Unfiltered live stats are supplied as-read from the Material Spreader unit. Readings do not consider total spread rate(s) over time or distance.
     * - `spreaderGranularRate`: Granular spread rate reading in milliliters per meter, read from the material spreader. Unfiltered live stats are supplied as-read from the Material Spreader unit. Readings do not consider total spread rate(s) over time or distance.
     * - `spreaderPrewetRate`: Prewet spread rate reading in milliliters per meter, read from the material spreader. Unfiltered live stats are supplied as-read from the Material Spreader unit. Readings do not consider total spread rate(s) over time or distance.
